# BoxdBuddies Post-Cleanup Audit Report

Generated by AI: GitHub Copilot - 2025-09-06

## Summary

- Purpose: Remove legacy desktop/Tauri noise and make `functions/` web-ready by gating informational logs, consolidating runtime helper declarations, and reducing noisy logs.
- Branch: `audit/cleanupreport-sept2025` (updates pushed to existing PR #87).

## What I changed

- Implemented debug gating helpers in `functions/_lib/common.js`: `isDebug(env)` and `debugLog(env, ...args)`.

- Consolidated TypeScript declarations for the runtime helper so both `../../_lib/common` and `../../_lib/common.js` resolve cleanly:
  - Canonical declarations placed under `functions/_types/`:
    - `functions/_types/ambient-common.d.ts`
    - `functions/_types/common-modules.d.ts`
  - Neutralized duplicate/overlapping `.d.ts` files under `functions/_lib` to avoid duplicate-symbol and lint `no-redeclare` errors (these files now contain pointer comments to the canonical declarations).

- Replaced noisy informational `console.*` usages with `debugLog(env, ...)` in several functions (left `console.error` intact for error paths).

- Normalized some imports to the helper module where safe (prefer `../../_lib/common` for static imports); added ambient/wildcard declarations to cover dynamic `.js` import forms.

- Tests: fixed flakiness in `functions/__tests__/cache.unit.test.ts` by clearing mocks between tests; removed `// @ts-nocheck` in that test and adjusted fixtures to include `TMDB_API_KEY` where necessary.

## Files touched (representative)

- `functions/_lib/common.js` (debug helpers added)
- `functions/_lib/common.d.ts` (ES module declarations)
- `functions/_lib/common.js.d.ts` (neutralized)
- `functions/_lib/common-ambient.d.ts` (neutralized)
- `functions/_lib/common-module-declare.d.ts` (neutralized)
- `functions/_types/ambient-common.d.ts` (canonical declarations)
- `functions/_types/common-modules.d.ts` (canonical wildcard declarations)
- `functions/letterboxd/cache/index.ts` (debugLog usage, types)
- `functions/letterboxd/friends/index.ts` (import normalization)
- `functions/api/watchlist-count-updates/index.ts` (warn → debugLog)
- `functions/__tests__/cache.unit.test.ts` (clear mocks; removed @ts-nocheck)

## Validation performed

- Unit tests: Ran test suite locally — all tests passed.

- TypeScript: Ran `npm run type-check` and resolved the `debugLog` missing-declaration errors by adding the proper declarations; no blocking TS errors remain in the working tree after the changes.

- Lint/hooks: Fixed issues that blocked pre-commit and ensured commits succeed with `lint-staged`.

## Remaining / recommended follow-ups

1. Replace any remaining informational `console.*` occurrences with `debugLog` (I converted most; run `grep -R "console\.log\(|console\.warn\(|console\.info\(" functions/` to find any leftovers).
2. Consider removing or permanently deleting the neutralized `.d.ts` files under `functions/_lib` once the team confirms the canonical `functions/_types` coverage is correct (neutralizing is reversible and safe for now).
3. Run full CI (type-check, lint, unit tests) from the main CI environment to confirm no environment-specific issues.

## How I committed

- Commit message: `chore(cleanup): neutralize duplicate helper declarations; remove @ts-nocheck and clear mocks in cache tests`
- Branch: `audit/cleanupreport-sept2025` — pushed to origin to update PR #87.

## Next actions I can take (pick one or more)

- Run a full lint pass and fix remaining style warnings.
- Remove the neutralized `.d.ts` files completely if you want cleaner tree (I left them neutralized to be safe).
- Create a short PR description update or add additional documentation to `README.md` or `SETUP.md` describing the debugLog logging policy.

If you'd like, I will now remove the neutralized `.d.ts` files, run a final lint check, and produce a small PR description update — or I can stop here and wait for your instruction.
