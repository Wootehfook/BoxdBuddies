# BoxdBuddies Post-Cleanup Audit Report

**Generated by AI: GitHub Copilot - 2025-08-07**

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the results of a comprehensive codebase cleanup, transitioning BoxdBuddies from a hybrid desktop/web (Tauri/Rust) architecture to a pure web stack (React + Cloudflare). All legacy, obsolete, and non-web artifacts have been systematically removed. The codebase is now fully web-oriented, with only relevant scripts, configuration, and documentation retained.

---

## Cleanup Actions Summary

**Files/Artifacts Deleted:**
- Legacy scripts (PowerShell, Python, etc.)
- Temporary/test scripts and output artifacts
- Log files and folders
- Outdated configuration files (e.g., .hintrc)
- All Tauri/Rust/Clippy-related code and config

**Rationale:**
- Remove all non-web, desktop, and legacy artifacts
- Eliminate test/dev output and logs from version control
- Ensure only production-relevant scripts and configs remain
- Modernize CI/CD, devcontainer, and documentation for web-only development

---

## Inventory Overview (Post-Cleanup)

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend/Infra:** Cloudflare Pages, Functions, D1 (SQLite)
- **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (web-only workflows)
- **Devcontainer:** Node.js-based, MCP automation
- **Database:** D1 with `tmdb_movies` and related tables
- **Scripts:** Only web/MCP/utility scripts retained
- **Config:** `.prettierrc`, `.lintstagedrc`, `.gitignore`, etc. (web-only)
- **Documentation:** Merged, updated, and cleaned for web focus

## File Categorization Patterns

- **Source:** `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
- **Config/Doc:** `.json`, `.jsonl`, `.sql`, `.env`, `.toml`, `.lock`, `.config`, `.rc`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.ini`, `.example`, `.local`, `.md`, `.txt`, `.html`, etc.
- **Script:** `.sh`, `.ps1`, `.bat`, `.cmd`, `.py`
- **Potential Legacy/Temp:** `test`, `tests`, `__tests__`, `spec`, `smoke`, `probe`, `init`, `remove`, `fix`, `setup`, `logs`, `out`, `temp`, `archived`, `attic`
- **Documentation:** `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `CHANGELOG`, `SECURITY`, `POLICY`, `REPORT`, `SUMMARY`, `AUDIT`, `COMPLETE`, `PLAN`, `RELEASE`, `WORKFLOW`, `STATUS`

---

## Current State Validation

- No legacy desktop/tauri code or scripts remain
- All documentation is merged, updated, and web-focused
- CI/CD workflows are web-only and up to date
- Devcontainer is Node.js-based, no Rust/Tauri
- Only web/MCP/utility scripts are present
- All config files are relevant to the web stack
- `.ai-internal/` contains audit, planning, and inventory files for traceability

---

## Conclusion

The BoxdBuddies codebase is now fully modernized and web-focused. All legacy, obsolete, and non-web artifacts have been removed. The project is ready for web deployment and ongoing development with a clean, maintainable, and production-ready codebase.
