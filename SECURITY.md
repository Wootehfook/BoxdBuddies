# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow one of the options below so we can address it promptly:

- Preferred: Use GitHub's security advisory / security vulnerability reporting (recommended) by going to the repository's "Security" tab and opening a private security advisory.
- Alternatively: Open a new issue with the label `security` and include steps to reproduce, affected versions/commits, and any PoC or logs.

Please do not include sensitive data (API keys, secrets) in public issues. If you need to share sensitive information, use GitHub's private security advisory flow or contact the maintainers via the repository's security contact.

Maintainers will triage and respond to reports within a reasonable timeframe.
