# Security Policy

## üîí Supported Versions

BoxdBuddy is currently a production web application. Security updates will be provided for:

| Version | Supported                 |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| 2.0.x   | ‚úÖ **Currently Active**   |
| 1.0.x   | ‚ùå **Deprecated Desktop** |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

- **Cloudflare Security**: Web Application Firewall (WAF) and DDoS protection
- **Input Validation**: All external inputs (Letterboxd scraping, TMDB API) are validated server-side
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored in Cloudflare secrets
- **No User API Keys**: Server-side TMDB integration, no user credentials required
- **Database Security**: Cloudflare D1 with parameterized queries to prevent injection
- **CORS Protection**: Strict origin allowlisting for API endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Request throttling to prevent abuse

### Data Handling

- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only processes data during active sessions
- **No Persistent User Data**: Session-based processing, no long-term storage
- **No User Tracking**: No analytics or telemetry collection
- **Respect for Source APIs**: Complies with TMDB and Letterboxd terms of service
- **Edge Computing**: Cloudflare's global network ensures data proximity and security

### Web Security Standards

- **HTTPS Everywhere**: All traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers prevent XSS attacks
- **Secure Headers**: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options implemented
- **No Third-party Scripts**: Self-contained application with minimal external dependencies

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### How to Report

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab ‚Üí "Report a vulnerability" (preferred)
2. **Email**: For sensitive issues, contact via GitHub profile
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if known)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates**: Every 7 days until resolution
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available (coordinated disclosure)

## üîç Security Scope

### In Scope

- Application security vulnerabilities
- Data handling issues
- Authentication/authorization flaws
- Code injection vulnerabilities
- Dependency vulnerabilities

### Out of Scope

- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- Denial of service attacks
- Issues requiring physical access to the device

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

- Never commit API keys, passwords, or sensitive data
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Validate all external inputs
- Follow secure coding guidelines for Rust and TypeScript
- Run security linters and dependency checks

### Dependencies

- Keep dependencies updated
- Regularly run `npm audit` and `cargo audit`
- Review new dependencies for security issues
- Use minimal required permissions

### Environment

- Use `.env` files for local development
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use strong, unique passwords

## üîê Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

1. **Acknowledge** your report promptly
2. **Investigate** thoroughly and fairly
3. **Fix** vulnerabilities as quickly as possible
4. **Credit** researchers appropriately (if desired)
5. **Coordinate** public disclosure timing

## üìã Security Checklist for Releases
