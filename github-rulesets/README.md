### 🚀 `release-hotfix-ruleset.json` - Release Quality

- **Protection Level**: Maximum
- **Required Reviews**: 2 reviewers + code owner approval
- **Status Checks**: All 6 CI/CD jobs must pass
- **Security**: Same as main branch (signed commits, linear history)
- **Use Case**: Release preparation and emergency fixes

## 🎯 Status Check Integration

All rulesets are configured with your exact CI/CD workflow **status check contexts**:

1. **frontend-quality-checks** - TypeScript compilation, linting, formatting
2. **backend-quality-checks** - Lint, type-check, and unit tests
3. **security-audit** - NPM security vulnerability scanning
4. **code-quality-analysis** - Codacy CLI analysis and pre-commit hook verification
5. **license-compliance-check** - AGPL license header verification (main and release branches only)
6. **📊 Generate Report** - PR conversation handler report

**Important**: GitHub status checks use the job's `name:` field if present, otherwise the job ID. For example:
- Job with no explicit name: `frontend-quality-checks:` → status check context is `frontend-quality-checks`
- Job with name field: `report:` with `name: "📊 Generate Report"` → status check context is `📊 Generate Report`

The workflow name (top of the file) is never used for status check contexts.
