# Public Assets

This directory contains static assets that will be served by Vite during development and included in the build.

## Required Files

You should add the following files to this directory:

- `tauri.svg` - Tauri logo for the main page
- `vite.svg` - Vite logo for the main page  
- `react.svg` - React logo for the main page
- `favicon.ico` - Browser favicon

## Usage

Files in this directory can be referenced from your HTML and React components using absolute paths:

```html
<img src="/tauri.svg" alt="Tauri logo" />
```

```jsx
<img src="/vite.svg" alt="Vite logo" />
```

For now, these are placeholder references. You can download the actual logos from:
- Tauri: https://tauri.app/
- Vite: https://vitejs.dev/
- React: https://reactjs.org/
