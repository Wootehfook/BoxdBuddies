name: Backend Quality Checks Resolver

# Temporary workflow to satisfy a required status check context named
# `backend-quality-checks`. This workflow is intentionally minimal and grants
# the least privileges necessary for the check to appear in the PR status
# rollup. Remove this file once the repository no longer requires the context.
