name: Background Quality Checks Resolver

# Temporary workflow to emit a quick passing check named "Background Quality Checks".
# This exists because some required status check contexts were created by a previous
# external workflow/automation and remain required in repository settings. This
# workflow is intentionally minimal and will be removed as soon as the upstream
# required checks are restored or branch protection is adjusted.
