# Pre-push hook stub.
#
# The actual pre-push behavior (e.g. protected-branch checks) is managed
# and installed by scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh. That script is the single
# source of truth for the hook contents and may overwrite this file.
#
# This tracked file is intentionally minimal to avoid duplicating logic
# from scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh and prevent configuration drift.
#
# To install the full hook, run: bash scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
#
# If the setup script has not been run, we allow the push by default.
