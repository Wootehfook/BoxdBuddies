# PR: feat: watchlist cache setup (branch: watchlist-cache-implementation)

Summary

This PR resolves merge conflicts and cleans up types, tests, and lint issues to make the branch mergeable.

What I changed

- Removed merge conflict artifacts across Cloudflare Functions and unified `Env` typing by using the cache module as the canonical source of truth.
- Centralized friends cache normalization in `functions/letterboxd/cache/index.ts` via `setCachedFriends` to avoid data-shape drift.
- Replaced unsafe `any` casts in critical modules and tests with minimal local types and small type guards where necessary.
- Hardened D1 read/write code with safe parsing and validation to prevent runtime shape mismatches.
- Improved tests: removed/rewrote noisy tests that relied on `any`, added explicit test-friendly mocks for D1 and fetch, and ensured tests run in a Node environment.

Validation performed (local)

- TypeScript: `npm run type-check` — PASS (no errors)
- ESLint: `npm run lint` — PASS for modified files (no blocking warnings)
- Tests: `npm test` — PASS (12 test files, 80 tests passed)

Files of interest (high-level)

- `functions/letterboxd/cache/index.ts` — canonical Env + D1 parsing, `getCount`/`setCount`, lock helpers
- `functions/letterboxd/friends/index.ts` — now imports canonical `Env` and uses `setCachedFriends`
- `src/services/watchlistFetcher.ts` — removed `any`, added small type guards
- `functions/__tests__/cache.unit.test.ts` and other tests — cleaned up to use typed mocks

Why these changes

- The branch had merge-artifact corruption, inconsistent Env shapes, and test/lint noise that prevented CI from running cleanly. These fixes are targeted and low-risk; the core behavior remains the same but safer and easier to review.

Notes for reviewers

- Focus review on the canonicalization decision: `functions/letterboxd/cache/index.ts` is now the source-of-truth for function-level `Env`. Other functions import/extend this type as needed.
- Spot-check D1 parsing in `functions/letterboxd/cache/index.ts`: ensure the validation logic matches expectations for stored schemas.
- Tests and type-check were run locally; CI should confirm the same on remote.

How to reproduce locally

- Install deps: `npm install`
- Type-check: `npm run type-check`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Tests: `npm test`
